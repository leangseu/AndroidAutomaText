 **WEEK ONE** 
 >This week we tackled 2 initial main hurdles for our project. When you start a mobile project, you need to brainstorm the best technologies to use. Obviously, for a texting app, you need some form of texting API. We already had interest in Twilio, so James went ahead and set that up this week. Leangseu worked on setting up the initial front end. Right now Alex and TJ are working on designs and planning on the database tables. TJ is also linking the UI with stub functions, and creating the Custom Adapter to display the text messages on the home screen. Alex has begun adjustments to the layout and color/UI to make the project look more user friendly.
